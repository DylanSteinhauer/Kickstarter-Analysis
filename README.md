# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
We peformed an analysis on Kickstarter data to help hopeful playwright, Louise. We filtered data, created plots and charts, and used statistics to help Louise determine how much money to raise and what her chances were of being successful.

For her play "Fever", Louise should lower her Kickstarter goal considerably in order to achieve success. Her goal is more than double the mean of successful campaigns for plays. Additionally, the median pledged for successful campaigns is even lower, so she might want to consider asking for less than $3,000. Also, Louise should look to get a musical funded in Great Britain but seek less than $4,000 in order to have a good chance at success.
